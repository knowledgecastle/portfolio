                    The project involved rebuilding a messy Notion content dashboard for a real estate client into a
                    clean, functional Brand HQ. Key improvements included restructuring the workspace, standardizing
                    content workflows, and implementing practical solutions for Notion's limitations. The process
                    involved auditing the existing setup, planning a parallel rebuild, and enabling the client with
                    walkthroughs and notifications for effective usage and management.

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <hr style="border-color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; opacity: 0.5;">
                <ul>
                    <li>The client had an existing Notion content dashboard that had been built by another freelancer,
                        but it had become <em>messy, confusing, duplicated,</em> and not usable day-to-day.</li>
                    <li>Updates in one “channel page” were unintentionally affecting other pages because everything was
                        using the same underlying database (so edits were “leaking” across channels).</li>
                    <li>The client wanted a clear end-to-end workflow across multiple platforms (Instagram, YouTube,
                        Email, etc.) with an easy way to track stages like idea → script → record → edit → schedule →
                        publish, plus ownership and performance tracking.</li>
                    <li>The old workspace structure also created practical issues: visibility/access problems, a missing
                        or hard-to-find content calendar, and UI constraints like platform icons stacking in
                        board/gallery views.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                        The Solution
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rebuilt the dashboard into a <em>clean, central Brand HQ</em> that the client can actually
                            use every day, without risking damage to the previous (messy) inline-dashboard setup.</li>
                        <li>Restructured the workspace by creating a new Teamspace for the “official” HQ and archiving
                            the old HQ, then fixing permissions by adding the client as an Owner so the new HQ was
                            visible.</li>
                        <li>Restored and repositioned key navigation elements like the Content Calendar, ensuring it was
                            not deleted and was accessible in the new structure.</li>
                        <li>Standardized the content workflow and views so content can move through stages clearly,
                            while keeping databases and relations logical (simple, not over-engineered).</li>
                        <li>Cleaned up the databases by removing unnecessary templates and standardizing how content
                            items are created.</li>
                        <li>Implemented practical workarounds where Notion has limitations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Icons can display side-by-side in Table view but will stack in Board/Gallery, so the
                                    dashboard uses the most appropriate view for the desired layout.</li>
                                <li>Platform “logo-only” selections require a separate database and a naming workaround
                                    (e.g., using a space) because Notion pages cannot be unnamed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Added / standardized the process checklist so it is available per content item (and can be
                            embedded consistently without relying on a separate “checklist database” structure that
                            causes issues).</li>
                        <li>Added an EOD reporting system as a dedicated database with daily tasks and notifications, so
                            the assigned person gets a reminder and the client gets a completion history.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                        The Process
                    </h3>
                    <ol style="list-style: decimal; margin-left: 1.5rem; color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Audit + scope confirmation</strong><br>
                            Reviewed the client’s Loom walkthrough to understand exactly what was broken and what “done”
                            needed to look like. Confirmed timeline, estimated effort (1–2 hours initially), and
                            clarified constraints and tradeoffs (database separation, icon limitations).</li>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Plan to salvage without breaking existing
                                structure</strong><br>
                            Decided to rebuild a clean HQ in parallel rather than patching the messy structure.</li>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Rebuild the HQ (structure + navigation)</strong><br>
                            Created the new Brand HQ as a Teamspace and archived the old HQ. Moved/relocated key assets
                            (like the Content Calendar) into the new HQ, then ensured it was discoverable in the menu.
                        </li>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Workflow + views setup</strong><br>
                            Separated the system into clearer data structures (e.g., separating YouTube vs Socials into
                            separate databases when needed) to stop cross-channel side effects. Set up the core stages
                            (idea → script → record → edit → schedule → published) and adjusted view layout choices to
                            match what the client wanted to see. Built the key operational views (e.g., views filtered
                            by Owner, and views for the Video Editor / Thumbnail workflow) so each person sees only what
                            matters. Configured sorting so “Ready to edit” is ordered by the publishing timeline.
                            Optimized dashboard ordering.</li>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>UI fixes + Notion limitations management</strong><br>
                            Investigated and explained the icon stacking behavior across view types, then implemented
                            the best compromise. Created the Social “icons database” workaround (including an “empty
                            name” workaround using a space) to display platform logos. Updated social channel icons
                            (including two Instagram accounts) and ensured new items inherit the right icon by default.
                        </li>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Client enablement (videos + mini SOP)</strong><br>
                            Delivered Loom/Drive walkthroughs showing what changed, why it changed, and how to
                            reorganize properties in database page layouts. Implemented and validated notifications
                            based on statuses. Provided guidance to troubleshoot common issues. Clarified
                            funnel/pipeline structure options.</li>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Add-ons and refinements</strong><br>
                            Implemented the EOD daily reporting database with reminders/notifications. Continued
                            iterative improvements based on client Loom feedback until the system was stable and usable.
